/* Thought Questions: 
 * 
 * 1)
 * The RevComparator compare method will return the opposite (negative) value 
 * of the original comparator (passed into the constructor). 
 * In other words, the comparator reverses the comparison. 
 * When the MyVector of Integer objects is sorted using the RevComparator (with
 * an IntegerComparator passed in its constructor), the MyVector will be
 * sorted in the reverse order of how it would be sorted if an IntegerComparator
 * was used.
 * If the IntegerComparator would have sorted in ascending order, 
 * the RevComparator will sort in descending order, and vice versa.
 * 
 * 2)
 * I would add a private instance variable to our comparator of type Comparator.
 * Let's call this Comparator instance variable kingComparator.
 * In the compare method of our comparator, call the compare method of kingComparator,
 * which is safe because kingComparator is type Comparator â€” an interface that requires
 * a compare method.
 * In mutator methods inside of our comparator, set the kingComparator to other
 * comparators that implement Comparator, thus changing the functionality of our compare method
 * and the "mode" of our comparator.
 * This is because our compare method calls kingComparator's compare method, 
 * which is the compare method of whichever comparator the kingComparator is currently set to.

/* Classes:
 * 
 * SpaceShip
 * 
 * Invader (1 invader)
 * 
 * Pack (2-D array of invaders, active object)
 * 
 * Laser (like colonizers, does it overlap with the target)
 * 
 * Shootable Interface (used by both invaders and spaceship)
 * We used this interface to pass in which type of ship, invader or mothership, is the one shooting
 * for the Bullet class
 * We passed in a Shootable object and used methods outlined by the interface to access its targets
 * and determine if it is a mothership or invader
 * Another way to use this class would be to make the targets an array of Shootable objects, and utilize
 * its functionality accordingly, but we went implemented the first option.

/* Thought Questions:
 * 
 * 1) 
 * For its release in 1978, Space Invaders introduced unique game features that undoubtedly
 * contributed to its success. Space Invaders popularized the shooting game concept, with
 * opponents that move and fight back, introducing a level of skill and strategy. The game also
 * brought a competitive atmosphere, by recording global/arcade achievements with a leader board.
 * The time limited aspect of the game, as Invaders slowly speed up, was also a novel and captivating
 * idea. This concept puts the user under pressure, increasing both frustration from losing and motivation
 * to win.I also think that the recognizable music and sounds of the game added to the its
 * success.
 * 
 * 
 * 2)
 * I would make a new class called Base, that displays a visible image on a certain location on the screen.
 * The class would include an integer instance variable that tracks its health. After 3 bases are initialized
 * in SpaceInvaders at the start of the game, they are all added to the target array of both the ship and the 
 * invaders. As the Bullet class checks if it overlaps with one of the targets, if the target is a Base object,
 * the bullet will hide itself and the class will call a mutator method in the Base class 
 * that decreases its health. Using an accessor method, if the health is 0, hide the Base image from the screen.
 *  
 * If I wanted to also have parts of the Base be removed by the Bullet, I would make the Base a collection of small 
 * Filled Rectangles, and remove the rectangle from the position that the bullet collides with it.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 3)
 * I would create new class called ufo that when constructed, would created a visible image that shows a ufo. 
 * It would extend Active Object and the run method would move it from one side of the screen to any other. 
 * ufo class will be Shootable and everytime the bullet moves it will check if it has hit ufo, the ufo will be 
 * added to the mothershipâ€™s targets. If the ufo makes it across the screen, 
 * call a function in the base class that destroys the base. If the bullet does overlap with the ufo,
 * hide the ufo and the bullet.
 */

/* Extensions:
 * 
 * User can select between 3 different speeds at the beginning of each game
 * If the user does not select anything, the same speed as the last game is kept,
 * and if it is the first game, the default speed is 2 (medium difficulty)
 * 
 * 
 * Music and Sounds:
 * Invader shooting
 * Mothership shooting
 * Background music
 * Invader hit
 * Mothership hit
 *
